1. Introduction

**_____________________________________________**


    We decided to investigate to what extent volcanic activity like volcanic ash and testing of nuclear weapons affect vegetation on Earth, by comparing areas that are or have been affected, to areas that haven’t. We also wanted to use the data we gathered from the ISS to compare it with old NDVI data from NASA's archive, but we did not succeed because the data we got was not affected by circumstances we decided to measure at the same time NASA was gathering NDVI data. We think that this experiment is interesting because all of us like explosions and we wanted to investigate how they affect vegetation on Earth. We expect to find out that volcanoes help vegetation to grow and that nuclear activity doesn’t affect vegetation. 

Here is our fly-in ISS, unfortunately, a big part of the earth was surrounded by clouds at the time of our investigation, so we got little data, but we think we used it the best way we could. 

2. Method

**_____________________________________________**

We decided to measure how volcanic activity and nuclear explosions affect vegetation on earth. We used a camera with an NDVI filter to take photos and save them in JPEG format along with data to find the location and time photos were taken, we kept these types of data in a CSV file 

When we got the data, we wrote a script that calculates average vegetation on photos we gathered from the ISS and NDVI data from NASA's archives. The script takes one or two photos, one from ISS and one from an HDF file from the MOBIUS sensor that we found on search.earthdata.nasa.gov, this program can cut off every unnecessary detail and remain just vegetation as you can see in the photo. As an output, we get the average brightness of the images. It represents the average amount of vegetation, we are not calculating the NDVI value because we are only interested in comparing data with photos in NASA's archive or areas we got photos of. With average brightness, we can calculate the average density of vegetation that we use for compressing.

3. Experiment results 

**_____________________________________________**

We flew over two areas that we found useful:



* One is the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in Kazaschant which is the biggest Soviet nuclear polygon.
* The other one is the west part of Japan. Japan is full of volcanoes, and the part that we were lucky to get. Has active volcanoes nearby. 

The volcano that we used for analyzing the effect volcanoes have on vegetation is called Niigata-Yake-Yama. The last time it erupted was in 1974. NASA doesn't have NDVI data that goes so far back in time. So we could not analyze it the way we initially wanted. Instead, we compared vegetation near the volcano with vegetation in an area of Japan with no volcanoes, this region is the coast of Tottori. 		

We found no evidence for our Hypothesis. The density of vegetation on the coast of Tottori is around 80% and the vegetation near volcano Niigata-Yake-Yama is 79.2% practically the same. We think it might be caused by the date of the last eruptions or the soil in Japan is so good it supports a big density of vegetation in all areas, so even if the soil would had more nutrients it wouldn't affect the density of vegetation. 	

This test site was in use from 1945 to 1991, NASA's NDVI data go back to 2000 so we could not analyze the initial effect of radiation on the vegetation nearby. So instead we compared the area around the site with other parts of Kazakhstan that were not affected by radiation. The exact place of testing is partly covered by clouds and shadows of clouds. So we got data just from a small portion of this area. 

Although we found no evidence that radiation from nuclear explosions affects the amount of vegetation on earth, as expected. 

4. Learnings

**_____________________________________________**


    This is a new section this year. Please tell us about your experience working as a team on Mission Space Lab. This shouldn’t just be limited to skills such as coding, using the hardware and analysis techniques (although we would love to hear about this too!). For example:


        ● 	How did you plan and organise your work as a team?


        ● 	What challenges did you experience and how did you overcome them?


        ● 	What did you learn?


        ● 	What would you do differently next time?


    This section is limited to 200 words.


    Our team is made of students who like data science, physics, and electronics, so it was fun for us to participate. We had many meetings to have good communication in the team, we made a discord server for sharing data and talking. In addition, our mentor created an ITS learning class where we could share heavy files. The organization of work wasn't demanding for each member, we spoke about what must be done and if anyone had time then he did as much as he wanted. We organized it this way because we had a lot of time to get the work done. The biggest challenge was that we didn't know how to analyze photos, so we needed to develop a way of doing that by ourselves, luckily one of us has previous experience working with CV2 so we got this without learning everything from scratch. We learned to use NASA's archives and take data from these as well as work with the .hdf format that is used for storing scientific data. Next time we would be together in the same room when we worked on coding and analyzing. We did not do that and that caused communication problems.


    5. Conclusion 


    **_____________________________________________**


    Don’t leave writing this section until the last minute — it is the most important! This is the final section that judges will read and should bring everything from your previous sections together. It is an opportunity for the team to share their reflections on their experience, their experiment design and results, and conclude on their findings. Did you find out what you were expecting? If not, why not? If your experiment did not produce any valid results, explain what you think went wrong and what you would do differently next time. This is still a valid finding.


    This section is limited to 200 words. 


    Based on our findings, we cannot prove our initial hypothesis that volcanoes _would_ help vegetation growth. But we can conclude that Vegetation in Japan is not affected by volcanic eruptions older than 50 years. Though this may not be the case in other locations, as we only analyzed a single volcanic site.


    The data from the nuclear site concur to our hypothesis because we found no evidence that radiation from nuclear explosions affects the amount of vegetation on earth in any direction


    In addition, we learned a lot of things about analyzing photos and gathering data from the internet. 


    We would love to thank ESA and Easpberry PI foundation for making AstroPI happen and that we could participate 



* Semipalatinsk nuclear test

    We didn't get the data that could conclude from that our initial hypothesis about volcanoes. 


    Despite the amount of data we found useful, we think the experiment was successful because after analyzing we can conclude a few things:

* Vegetation in Japan is not affected by volcanic eruptions older than 50 	years.
* Nuclear explosions older than 30 years do not affect vegetation. 

    In addition, we learned a lot of things about analyzing photos and gathering data from the internet.
